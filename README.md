## What is Flips?
Flips is a simple music player with nice features designed for everyday users. The main goal of Flips is to be fast and user-friendly. It is made with HTML, JavaScript and CSS and runs on the Electron framework.

## How do I start it?
Flips is an ongoing project with an early build available. Follow these steps to run the application:

* Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not then [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It shouldn't matter whether you use the LTS or Current version.
* LINUX USERS: Make sure to install the `npm` package if you installed Node.js through your package manager. Distributions such as Ubuntu Linux might include npm with Node.js, but Arch Linux might not.
* Extract the file if you downloaded the compressed version (ZIP). If you cloned the repository instead then go to the next step.
* Open Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or the terminal of your choice on macOS/Linux.
* Navigate to the location of Flips and go inside the folder.
* Run `npm install` and wait for the packages to install.
* Please note that due to the application being in early development, various libraries may be added or removed, so if there are any changes to the libraries then please run `npm update`.
* If no errors appeared then run `npm start` and start listening!
